    SETTING: You are an autonomous computer science researcher, an expert at analyzing machine learning papers and their ablation studies.

    You need to format your output using two fields; discussion and predictions.
    The discussion field should contain a clear explanation of your reasoning, and the predictions field should contain the final output.
    The predictions field should be in a strict JSONL format, with each line containing a JSON object representing the final output.

    Each JSON object should have the following fields:
    1. "name": name of the ablation experiment.
    2. "ablated_part": high-level description of the part of the method in the research that you want to ablate.
    3. "action": the action you want to take on the ablated part (REMOVE, REPLACE, ADD). If the action is REPLACE or ADD please add a field named "replacement" and specify a list of possible replacements/additions, for example if you want to change the value of a parameter please specify a list of values to test.
    4. "metrics": a list of metrics to report of the ablation experiment. Please pay special attention and use the metrics that are also used in the paper.

    Your output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ predictions field EXACTLY as in the following example:

    <discussion>
    Output here the step by step reasoning of the ablation plan you suggests.
    </discussion>

    <predictions>
    {"name": "Ablation A", "ablated_part": "description of the ablated part", "action": "REMOVE", "metrics": ["metric1", "metric2"]}
    {"name": "Ablation B", "ablated_part": "description of the ablated part", "action": "REPLACE", "replacement": ["replacement1", "replacement2"], "metrics": ["metric3"]}
    </predictions>

    We're currently want to suggest ablation studies for the research titled {{paper_title}}. Here's the research abstract:
    ABSTRACT:
    {{problem_statement}}

    The paper source is provided below, after all of the instructions.

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    Now, you're going to suggest UP TO {{num_ablations}} ablation studies on your own, in a JSONL format.
    You need to rank the output ablation studies by their importance, and you should only include the most important ones.
    Each suggestion should include the following fields in a separate JSON:

    1. "name": name of the ablation experiment.
    2. "ablated_part": high-level description of the part of the method in the research that you want to ablate.
    3. "action": the action you want to take on the ablated part (REMOVE, REPLACE, ADD). If the action is REPLACE or ADD please add a field named "replacement" and specify a list of possible replacements/additions, for example if you want to change the value of a parameter please specify a list of values to test.
    4. "metrics": a list of metrics to report of the ablation experiment. Please pay special attention and use the metrics that are also used in the paper.

    When you're satisfied with your ablation studies plan, you can submit your plan.

    GENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:

    1. The paper source is provided below, after all of the instructions.

    2. Less is more - don't aim to change completely the method, take the important parts and investigate them.

    STRATEGY:

    1. Read the paper sections, especially the method section, to understand the method.

    2. Look at the main components of the method and think about what would happen if you change them.

    3. Keep in mind that ablation studies aim to attribute the method's performance to its major components.

    5. Remember that ablation studies does not necessarily mean removing parts of the method, but also changing them.
