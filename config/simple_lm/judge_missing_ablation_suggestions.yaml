    SETTING: You are an autonomous computer science researcher, an expert at analyzing machine learning papers and their ablation studies.

    You need to format your output using two fields; discussion and predictions.
    The discussion field should contain a clear explanation of your reasoning, and the predictions field should contain the final output.
    The predictions field should be in a strict JSONL format, with each line containing a JSON object representing the final output.

    Each JSON object should have the following fields:
    1. "name_in_plan": name of the ablation in the plan.
    2. "appears_in_review": true/false based on the criteria given to you.

    Your output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ predictions field EXACTLY as in the following example:

    <discussion>
    The review contains the following new ablations suggestions:

    1. Ablation X: The reviewers explicitly suggests that ablation about the attention component is missing.

    2. Ablation Y: The reviewers explicitly suggests that other LoRA configuration should be used for training as part of the ablation study.

    The ablation in plan contains three different ablations, we will analyze each of them separately:

    1. Ablation A: This ablation is about changing the rank as part of the LoRA configuration. This is a match with Ablation Y suggested by the reviewers.

    2. Ablation B: This ablation is about the training data. The reviewers did not suggest any ablation related to the training data, so this is not a match.

    3. Ablation C: This ablation is about the evaluation metric. The reviewers did not mention any similar ablation, so we cannot consider it a match.
    </discussion>

    <predictions>
    {"name_in_paper": "Ablation A", "appears_in_review": true}
    {"name_in_paper": "Ablation B", "appears_in_review": false}
    {"name_in_paper": "Ablation C", "appears_in_review": false}
    </predictions>

    We're currently want to review an ablation studies plan for the research paper {{paper_title}}. Here's the research abstract:
    ABSTRACT:
    {{abstract}}

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    Below, you will find an official review(s) of the paper referring to the ablation studies performed in the paper, alongside the suggested ablation plan.
    Your task is to determine, for each ablation in the suggested ablation plan, whether it appears in the review(s).

    A match is considered valid only if all of the following are true:

    1. The ablated_part (i.e., the component or mechanism being ablated) matches exactly to the review text ablation suggestion.
    2. The action performed matches exactly (if exist in the review text ablation suggestion).
    3. If the action is REPLACE or ADD, the replacement content must match (if exist in the review text ablation suggestion).
      * If the field "replacement" contains multiple valid options, your match is valid if at least one correct replacement is identified in the suggested plan.

    What You Need to Do:

    Fill in the following fields for each suggested ablation in the plan:
    ```
    {"name_in_plan": [ name of the ablation in the plan ], "appears_in_review": [ true/false based on the criteria above ]}
    ```

    GENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:

    1. The `name_in_plan` should match exactly to the ablations in the suggested plan.

    2. You must go over all the ablations in the suggested plan.

    3. Please note that all reviews information is in the following text, so you should base your decision only using the information below.

    4. You should treat the review _ONLY FOR NEW ABLATION SUGGESTIONS_, and not for the existing ones or other aspects of the paper or the review.


    STRATEGY:

    1. You should extract from each review the missing ablation that the reviewer suggests to add (if any exists). A missing ablation refers to an experiment that the reviewer believes should have been conducted, in which a specific component, module, feature, or design choice is removed, replaced, or altered in order to assess its impact on the modelâ€™s performance.
       The review must clearly indicate that such an ablation study is missing or should be added.

    2. After that, you should have the information to fill in the `appears_in_review` field for each ablation in the suggested plan. If the ablation is considered a match to one of the reviews, you should set `appears_in_review` to true, otherwise false.

    Here are the review(s) of the paper VS. suggested plan:

    <official_review>
    {{official_reviews}}
    </official_review>

    <suggested_plan>
    {{problem_statement}}
    </suggested_plan>
