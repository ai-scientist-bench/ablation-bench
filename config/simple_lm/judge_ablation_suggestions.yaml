    SETTING: You are an autonomous computer science researcher, an expert at analyzing machine learning papers and their ablation studies.

    You are given a matching task between two sets of ablations: those presented in a research paper and those suggested in an ablation plan, but you do not know which set corresponds to the paper and which corresponds to the plan.
    A match means: The experiment described by ablation in side A is allowed or included as a possible option within ablation in side B (and vice versa).

    You need to format your output using two fields; discussion and predictions.
    The discussion field should contain a clear explanation of your reasoning, and the predictions field should contain the final output.
    The predictions field should be in a strict JSONL format, with each line containing a JSON object representing the final output.

    Each JSON object should have the following fields:
    1. "name_in_A": name(s) of the matching ablations in the ablations given in side A under <ablations_in_A></ablations_in_A>.
    2. "name_in_B": name(s) of the matching ablations in the ablations given in side B under <ablations_in_B></ablations_in_B>.

    Your output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ predictions field EXACTLY as in the following example:

    <discussion>
    The ablation in side A contains three different ablations and the ablation in side B contains 4 different ablations, we will analyze each of them separately:

    Side A:

    1. Ablation A: This ablation is about the model architecture. The ablations in side B contain a similar ablation (Ablation X) with the same part to be ablated and action, so we can consider it a match.

    2. Ablation B: This ablation is about the training data. The ablations in side B contain a similar ablation with a different name (Ablation Y), but the ablated part, action and replacement content match exactly, so we can consider it a match.

    3. Ablation C: This ablation is about the evaluation metric. The ablations in side B do not contain any similar ablation, so we cannot consider it a match.

    Side B:

    1. Ablation X: was matched to ablation A from side A.

    2. Ablation Y: was matched to ablation B from side A.

    3. Ablation Z: there is no matching ablation in side A.

    4. Ablation W: there is no matching ablation in side A.

    </discussion>

    <predictions>
    {"name_in_A": "Ablation A", "name_in_B": "Ablation X"}
    {"name_in_A": "Ablation B", "name_in_B": "Ablation Y"}
    {"name_in_A": "Ablation C", "name_in_B": null}
    {"name_in_A": null, "name_in_B": "Ablation Z"}
    {"name_in_A": null, "name_in_B": "Ablation W"}
    </predictions>

    We're currently want to review an ablation studies plan for the research paper {{paper_title}}. Here's the research abstract:
    ABSTRACT:
    {{abstract}}

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    Below, you will find the ablations performed in the paper and the suggested ablation plan.
    We do not provide any information which ablations belong to which source, so you need to carefully analyze each ablation in both paper and plan and determine if there is a match.
    Your task is to find a match between ablations in side A and ablations in side B, and vice versa.

    A match is considered valid only if all of the following are true:

    1. The `ablated_part` (i.e., the component or mechanism being ablated) must refer to the same component.

    2. The `action` in one ablation must be explicitly allowed by an ablation in the other side.

    3. If the action is REPLACE or ADD, the `replacement` content must have at least one valid option match.

    Examples:

    - REMOVE X → REPLACE X with [remove, Y]                MATCH
    - REPLACE X with Y → REMOVE X                          NO MATCH
    - REMOVE X → REMOVE X                                  MATCH
    - REPLAC X with [Y, Z] → REPLACE X with [Z, W]         MATCH
    - ADD Y to X → ADD  [Y, Z] to X                        MATCH
    - REPLACE (X+Y) with [X, Y, Z] → [REMOVE X, REMOVE Y]  MATCH

    Be conservative: if it is unclear whether one ablation allows the other ablation, do NOT match.

    The match can contain multiple ablations from either side, as long as the match meets the criteria above.
    For example, if an ablation in side A is split into two ablations in side B, but both of them together meet the matching criteria, then it is still considered a valid match.

    What You Need to Do:

    Fill in the following fields for each entry:
    ```
    {"name_in_A": [ name of the ablation in side A OR a list of ablation names in side A OR null if there is no matching ablation for the ablation in side B ], "name_in_B": [ name of the matching ablation from side B OR a list of ablation names in side B OR null if there is no matching ablation for the ablation in side A ]}
    ```

    GENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:

    1. The `name_in_A` and `name_in_B` should match exactly to the ablation names in side A and side B, respectively.

    2. You must go over ALL the ablations in side A and all ablations in side B, _each one of them should be in your prediction_.

    3. It is OK if one ablation from side A is split into multiple ablations in side B, or merged several side A ablations into one — as long as the matching criteria (per ablation in side A) are met, the match is still valid. This holds to the other direction as well (side B to side A).

    STRATEGY:

    1. For each ablation in side A, you should decide based on the criteria above if there is a valid match in side B, and vice versa.

    2. Please make sure to include in the discussion field the reasoning behind your decision for each ablation.

    3. After that, you should have the information to fill in the `name_in_B` / `name_in_A` fields for each ablation in side A and side B, respectively. If the ablation is considered a match to one (or more) of the ablations in the other side, you should fill the appropriate ablation(s) in `name_in_B` / `name_in_A`, otherwise it should remain null.

    Here are the ablations in side A and side B:

    <ablations_in_A>
    {{side_A}}
    </ablations_in_A>

    <ablations_in_B>
    {{side_B}}
    </ablations_in_B>

    **Remember to include all the ablations in side A and side B in your predictions!**

    BELOW IS AN EXAMPLE THAT WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THE FORMATTING AND THE TASK BETTER. PLEASE USE IT FOR YOU REFERENCE ONLY AND DO NOT REPEAT IT IN YOUR FINAL ANSWER.

    </ablations_in_B>

    <discussion>
    Let's go over all ablations in side A and side B to determine the matches based on the criteria provided.

    Side A:

    1. HybrIK Variant Comparison: This ablation replaces Adaptive HybrIK mechanism with several variants. In side B,  the ablation "Robustness of HybrIK to noise" deals with the adaptive HybrIK, it does replace it with one variant (GT joints) that matches side A variant (Naive HybrIK (using original parent joints)). Therefore, there is a match.
    2. Shape Parameter Study: This ablation replaces SMPL shape parameter prediction with different methods. In side B, "Effect of shape parameters (β)" replaces shape parameters with ground-truth and zero β, which does not align with the replacement criteria. Therefore, no match.
    3. Twist-Swing Ablation: This ablation replaces the twist-and-swing decomposition with other methods. In side B, "Analysis of the twist rotation" is the closest one, though it focuses on twist angles specifically. Therefore, no match.
    4. 3D Keypoint Estimation Study: This ablation replaces the 3D keypoint estimation component with various alternatives. None of the ablations in side B address this component, so no match.
    5. Twist angle prediction: This ablation replaces the twist angle prediction network with different methods. In side B, "Analysis of the twist rotation" again focuses on twist angles with one replacement (zero twist angles) that matches. Therefore, we have a match here.

    Side B:

    1. Analysis of the twist rotation: was matched to "Twist angle prediction" from side A.
    2. Error correction capability of HybrIK: There is no matching ablation in side A, as none of the ablations in side A address error correction on the predicted pose.
    3. Effect of shape parameters (β): There is no matching ablation in side A, the closes one is "Shape Parameter Study", but the replacements do not align.
    4. Robustness of HybrIK to noise: was matched to "HybrIK Variant Comparison" from side A.
