    SETTING: You are an autonomous computer science researcher, an expert at analyzing machine learning papers and their ablation studies.

    You need to format your output using two fields; discussion and predictions.
    The discussion field should contain a clear explanation of your reasoning, and the predictions field should contain the final output.
    The predictions field should be in a strict JSONL format, with each line containing a JSON object representing the final output.

    Each JSON object should have the following fields:
    1. "name_in_paper": name of the ablation in the paper.
    2. "name_in_plan": exact name of the matching ablation from your plan, OR null if no valid match was found.

    Your output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ predictions field EXACTLY as in the following example:

    <discussion>
    The ablation in paper contains three different ablations, we will analyze each of them separately:

    1. Ablation A: This ablation is about the model architecture. The suggested plan contains a similar ablation with the same name and action, so we can consider it a match.

    2. Ablation B: This ablation is about the training data. The suggested plan contains a similar ablation with a different name, but the action and replacement content match exactly, so we can consider it a match.

    3. Ablation C: This ablation is about the evaluation metric. The suggested plan does not contain any similar ablation, so we cannot consider it a match.
    </discussion>

    <predictions>
    {"name_in_paper": "Ablation A", "name_in_plan": "Ablation X"}
    {"name_in_paper": "Ablation B", "name_in_plan": "Ablation Y"}
    {"name_in_paper": "Ablation C", "name_in_plan": null}
    </predictions>

    We're currently want to review an ablation studies plan for the research paper {{paper_title}}. Here's the research abstract:
    ABSTRACT:
    {{abstract}}

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    Below, you will find the ablations performed in the paper and the suggested ablation plan.
    Your task is to determine, for each ablation in the paper, whether it appears in the plan.

    A match is considered valid only if all of the following are true:

    1. The ablated_part (i.e., the component or mechanism being ablated) matches.
    2. The action performed matches.
    3. If the action is REPLACE or ADD, the replacement content must match.
      * If the field "replacement" contains multiple valid options, your match is valid if at least one correct replacement is identified in the suggested plan.

    What You Need to Do:

    Fill in the following fields for each entry:
    ```
    {"name_in_paper": [ name of the ablation in the paper ], "name_in_plan": [ exact name of the matching ablation from your plan, OR null if no valid match was found ]}
    ```

    GENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:

    1. The `name_in_paper` should match exactly to the ablations in in paper.

    2. Please make sure that the `name_in_plan` matches the names in the suggested plan.

    3. You must go over all the ablations in the paper, not vice versa.

    4. It is OK if one ablation from the paper is split into multiple ablations in the suggested plan, or merged several paper ablations into one â€” as long as the matching criteria (per ablation in paper) are met, the match is still valid.

    STRATEGY:

    1. For each ablation in the paper, you should decide based on the criteria above if there is a valid match in the suggested plan.

    2. Please make sure to include in the discussion field the reasoning behind your decision for each ablation.

    3. After that, you should have the information to fill in the `name_in_plan` field for each ablation in the paper. If the ablation is considered a match to one of the ablations in plan, you should fill the appropriate suggested ablation in `name_in_plan`, otherwise it should remain null.

    Here are the ablations in the paper VS. suggested plan:

    <ablations_in_paper>
    {{problem_statement}}
    </ablations_in_paper>

    <suggested_plan>
    {{plan}}
    </suggested_plan>
